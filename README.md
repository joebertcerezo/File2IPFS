## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PNPM package manager
- Pinata account and JWT token

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joebertcerezo/File2IPFS.git
cd File2IPFS
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Configuration

1. **Get your Pinata JWT token**:

   - Sign up at [Pinata.cloud](https://pinata.cloud/)
   - Generate a JWT token from your API keys section

2. **Configure your gateway** (optional):

   - Set up a custom Pinata gateway for faster access
   - Use format: `your-gateway.mypinata.cloud`

3. **Enter credentials**:
   - Paste your JWT token in the configuration panel
   - Add your gateway URL if using a custom gateway
   - Click "Configure" to save settings

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: Enter your Pinata JWT token for secure API access
2. **Gateway Setup**: Configure your preferred IPFS gateway (optional)
3. **File Upload**: Drag and drop or select files to upload
4. **IPFS Integration**: Files are automatically pinned to IPFS via Pinata
5. **URL Generation**: Get instant IPFS URLs for your uploaded files
